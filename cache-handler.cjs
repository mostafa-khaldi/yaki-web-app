/**
 * Bounded ISR cache.
 *
 * Next's FileSystemCache never removes anything from disk: it has no unlink,
 * no cap, and expiry only makes `get()` return null so the page re-renders and
 * overwrites. The only LRU it has is in memory, and `cacheMaxMemorySize: 0` in
 * next.config.mjs disables that. Meanwhile the content routes have one URL per
 * nostr event, address or pubkey, so every distinct URL a crawler visits adds a
 * permanent `.html` + `.json` pair.
 *
 * Measured in production: 36,121 HTML files / 400 MB accumulated in ~2 hours,
 * inside a /var/lib/docker/overlay2 that had reached 26 GB -- roughly 4.8 GB a
 * day, unbounded. Measured locally: exactly 2.00 files per distinct-URL request.
 *
 * Simply not caching these routes would bound the disk but send every request
 * back to the relays, which is the cost the cache exists to avoid. So instead of
 * removing the cache, this bounds it: entries are still written and still
 * served, but once the cache exceeds its limit the oldest entries are deleted.
 * Disk becomes a flat line at the cap instead of a ramp, and repeat requests
 * still hit the cache rather than the relay pool.
 *
 * Tunable without a code change:
 *   ISR_CACHE_MAX_BYTES    default 2 GB
 *   ISR_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES  default 50,000 (backstop; entry sizes vary widely,
 *                          from ~2 KB for an unresolved page to 134 KB for a
 *                          profile carrying a full following list)
